<p>Hi :wave:, my name is Nick Lamprianidis and I'm from Veria, Greece. I received my diploma in Electrical Engineering & Computer Technology from the University of Patras, Greece in 2015. I'm currently working as a senior robot software developer in Munich, Germany.</p>

<p>I became involved in robotics with the simple aspiration to get one step closer to the future. I try to picture a world free of routine tasks and full of extraordinary everyday experiences. If we were to optimize our lives, new worthwhile and fulfilling opportunities could present themselves. Opportunities that could help one to live the life they hope to have and achieve greater goals.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with electronics and messing around with microcontrollers. My language of choice is C++, but I have fun with Python too. I once got introduced to compilers, and I liked it. I always enjoy learning new things, and I'm a big fan of MOOCs. I'm an enthusiastic maker; the day I realized my first 3D print, based on a concept I had in mind, was one of my most fulfilling moments. My work revolves around mobile robotics.</p>

<p>I'm a zealous supporter of open-source. I've benefited the most from this idea and I do my best to contribute back with every chance I get. In 2011, I joined a group of fellow students together with which we built P-Space (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PatrasSpace" ><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a>), the local hackerspace in Patras. A hackerspace is a place for people to get together, exchange ideas, find community support and equipment, and freely express their creativity. Being involved in this community offered me unique experiences that helped me get where I am today. Surprising things can happen when creative people interact. If you haven't already, find <a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_ALL_Hacker_Spaces">your local hackerspace</a> and join the team. If there isn't one near you, build it yourself. Gather your friends and meet in a room, a garage, or a coffee shop... it doesn't matter. What matters is sharing!</p>

<p>I'm not much of an athlete, but every now and then I'll hit the gym. My favorite singer is Dio. One of my favorite quotes is from <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/mahatmagan133995.html">Gandhi</a>. My oasis of serenity would be on a mountain side where the only sound comes from the rustling of the leaves :leaves: and the only sign of life from the breathing of the sea :ocean:.</p>
