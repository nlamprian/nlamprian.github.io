<p>Hi :wave:, my name is Nick Lamprianidis and I'm from Veria, Greece. I received my diploma in Electrical Engineering & Computer Technology from the University of Patras, Greece in 2015. I'm currently working as a Robot Software Developer in Munich, Germany.</p>

<p>I became involved in robotics with the simple aspiration to get one step closer to the future. I try to picture a world free of ironing, cleaning, cooking, ironing, driving, grocery shopping and so on... what would it look like? I keep dreaming of a world I thought I'd never... wait, Kevin Flynn said that :grimacing:. My point is our days are full of routine tasks that don't necessarily offer any value. If we were to optimize our lives, new worthwhile and fulfilling opportunities could present themselves, whether that is innovating on a new technology, or having some quality time with friends.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with electronics and messing around with microcontrollers. My favorite language is C++, and the love grows with every new version. But I have fun with Python too. It's very expressive and allows for quick and easy solutions. I once got introduced to compilers, and I liked it! I always enjoy learning new things, and I'm a big fan of MOOCs. I'm an enthusiastic maker. The day I realized my first 3D print, based on a concept I had in mind, was one of the most fulfilling moments of my life. My work revolves around mobile robotics.</p>

<p>I'm a zealous supporter of open-source. I've benefited the most from this idea and I do my best to give back with every chance I get. In 2011, I joined a group of fellow students together with which we built P-Space (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PatrasSpace" ><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a>), the local hackerspace in Patras. A hackerspace is a place for people to get together, exchange ideas, find community support and equipment, and freely express their creativity. Being involved in this community offered me unique experiences that helped me get where I am today. Surprising things can happen when creative people are interacting. If you haven't already, find <a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_ALL_Hacker_Spaces">your local hackerspace</a> and join the team. If there isn't one near you, build it yourself. Gather your friends and meet in a room, a garage, or a coffee shop... it doesn't matter. What matters is sharing!</p>

<p>I'm not much of an athlete, but every now and then I overcome my boredom and go swimming. I listen to various genres of music depending on my mood to keep me going through the day. My favorite singer is Dio. I watch TV shows... <a href="http://tiii.me/">a few months of them</a>. I enjoy reading about modern history. One of my favorite quotes is from <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/mahatmagan133995.html">Gandhi</a>. My special place would be on a mountain side where the only sound comes from the rustling of the leaves :leaves: and the only sign of life from the breathing of the sea :ocean:.</p>
