Curiosity has always driven me to get involved in many different areas at work.
The more I got involved, the more my responsibilities would grow.
Every day, I would willingly jump on whatever came my way, justifying it as
something that won't take too long, so I should quickly get it out of the way.
I was enjoying the process as it provided me with the small wins I needed to stay motivated.
One task after another, I would keep going like this, throwing all the time in my disposal into those tasks to compensate for the extra workload, and everything would eventually get done.
Surely, this strategy would bring results in the long term, but at what cost? The problem is that all my immediate plans would go out the window.
Moreover, this wasn't really a sustainable way of dealing with things.
One needs to work smarter, not harder.

Recently, I started a new chapter in a familiar role.
I returned to a job I had been doing for four years but with a fresh perspective, insight, and a clearer sense of direction.
I wanted to do things different this time around.
In the past, my decisions were driven by impulse and a need for comfort.
By now, I've grown beyond that, and I've learnt to manage stress without running away from it.
Today, I want plans and the resulting predictability that comes along with them.
But here is the thing: the circumstances have not changed.
The usual distractions are still there:
one quick question from a colleague, a request for a review or assistance, a decision that needs my input, etc.
There will always be something that requires our time and attention outside of what we plan for the day.
I started getting frustrated with this situation and I had to figure out what to do about it.

I needed to understand the problem first.
You know how Google observes your activity, identifies patterns, and makes recommendations?
In fact, that's how YouTube nudged me in the right direction one day with a video suggestion
(that was even before I started researching or discussing the topic).
The thumbnail read "You cannot improve what you don't measure".

The phrase is simple but powerful, and it's so obvious, right? I need information to be able to take decisions and make changes.
Let's analyze the problem.
Why was I frustrated? Because my workdays would end realizing that I failed to do what I planned for the day.
In any given day, one must do their planned work and any other work that results from working inside a team and with customers.
Now, here is the real question: how does one take the optimal decisions that strike the right balance between the different responsibilities and maximize the value of the work done?

For me, the first step was understanding time.
Specifically, I needed to better understand how and where I spend my time, how my time progresses during the day, and where and when I should draw a line and schedule something for another time.
I realized I needed a practical way to track my time.

I searched online for a device I could buy.
It couldn't be an app as I would constantly forget about it.
It had to be a physical device that could sit on my desktop, and interacting with it would be as automatic as locking and unlocking my computer.
However, all I found online was timers.
What I wanted was a stopwatch.
Eventually, I decided that I would build one myself. You may find out more about the device on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlamprian/time_tracker).

So, what has been my experience with the device so far?
To start, simply tracking my time has made a world of difference.
First, it removes the element of surprise - I stay aware of how my day flows and each moment I spent on something becomes a conscious decision.
Second, I can set boundaries for the end of the day; I know when I have fulfilled my duties and I can call it a day.
All of that eliminates the frustration out of the equation; that's already great progress.
But, most importantly, time has become an almost tangible resource I can use as feedback to review my actions, reflect on them, and adjust.
Now, all I need is an automated way to put everything in a graph, identify any momentary or persistent problematic patterns, and correct them.

Around this time, I also learned about the Pomodoro Technique.
Pomodoro carries some interesting ideas like time boxing and visualizing time.
However, I'm not so concerned with efficiency at this point.
My goal is maximizing effectiveness.
My concern is not staying productive, but strategically making choices that lead to meaningful progress, both for myself and those around me.
Even so, I might explore Pomodoro in the future and incorporate some of its ideas into the device.

This process will likely take time, and I can't wait to see where it leads.
If you found my story relatable, I hope my experience offers some insight to help you navigate your own situation.
And if you are interested in trying out the device for yourself, feel free to check out the code on GitHub and adapt it to your needs.
