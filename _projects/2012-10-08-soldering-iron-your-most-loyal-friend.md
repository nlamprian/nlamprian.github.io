On Monday 8-10-2012, I gave a speech on `Soldering`. The event was held at [P-Space](http://www.p-space.gr/), the local hackerspace at Patras, Greece. This was my first appearance in front of an audience. It was an awkward experience, but an interesting one nonetheless.

The main points of the speech were on:
* the significance of building printed circuit boards (PCBs) for the reliability and longevity of a project,
* the available tools for assembling and soldering a PCB, and
* the process for a successful solder joint.
