MUX74HC4067 is an **Arduino library** that offers an API for interfacing with the **74HC4067 multiplexers / demultiplexers**.

**Multiplexers** are devices that choose among a number of different inputs and channel that input to a single output. This way, a handful of sensors are now able to connect in turn to a computing device through a common bus. **Demultiplexers** work in the opposite direction. That is, they take one input signal and convey it to one of several outputs. They allow a computing device to use a single port to control many modules.

MUX74HC4067 simplifies the use of the **MUX** module and offers **safe operation**. That is, it makes sure that no signals get mixed up by always setting/resetting the right **channel** before anything is read or written to the **signal pin**.

There is a **tutorial** on MUX74HC4067 on [codebender's blog](http://blog.codebender.cc/2014/01/30/mux74hc4067/). The **source code** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlamprian/MUX74HC4067).
