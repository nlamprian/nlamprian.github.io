"My Shiny Metal Tooth" is an <b>autonomous illuminated sign</b> I built for my father's dental clinic.
<br>
<br>
The project is a sign in the form of a <b>tooth</b>, dressed with <b>EL-Wire</b>, and controlled by an <b>Arduino</b>. The Arduino checks the current and sunset time, and if the current time is within an interval from the sunset and a predefined turn off time, the sign turns on. While being on, visual effects are performed, like blinking and fading.
