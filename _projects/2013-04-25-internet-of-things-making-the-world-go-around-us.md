On Thursday 25-4-2013, I gave a speech on the `IoT`. The event was held at [P-Space](http://www.p-space.gr/), the local hackerspace at Patras, Greece.

Building something that can potentially communicate and operate at a global level sounds complicated, and it can be a scary thought. My intent with this speech was to demystify the concept and introduce it from the ground up.

The main points of the speech were on:
* the analysis of the structure of the Internet,
* examining the capabilities and restrictions of the Arduino microcontroller family,
* introducing the Xively (formerly known as Cosm and Pachube) data hosting service, and
* demonstrating some example applications.
