EMIC2 is an **Arduino library** that offers an API for interfacing with the **Emic 2 Text-to-Speech Module**.

**Emic 2** is a `speech synthesis` device for English and Spanish. It offers a number of different **voices** and allows for **dynamic control** of some voice and speech characteristics. It has an output for an **8 Ohm** speaker, and communicates through **UART**.

EMIC2 abstracts away the **operation of the Emic 2 module**. It offers an simple **API** for sending **messages** to the module. The messages can be provided **directly** or read from a **file in a SD card**. A number of **operators** is also supported for manipulating the speech, like raising the **volume level**, decreasing the **speaking rate**, and **pausing the playback**.

There is a **tutorial** on EMIC2 on [codebender's blog](http://blog.codebender.cc/2014/02/20/emic2/). The **source code** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlamprian/EMIC2).
